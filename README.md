# _amiga-debug_ Visual Studio Code Extension (Windows only)

**One-stop Visual Code Extention to compile and debug Amiga C programs compiled by included gcc 8.3.0 in WinUAE.**

## Quick-start
0. [Grab the latest release](https://github.com/BartmanAbyss/vscode-amiga-debug/releases) and follow installation instructions
1. Create a new project folder with `File > Open Folder...`
2. From the command palette <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> select `Amiga: Init Project`
3. Open `.vscode/launch.json` and point `"kickstart"` to your *Kickstart 1.3* ROM
3. Hit <kbd>F5</kbd> to build and run a minimal sample project

## Features
- No additional tools required. Everything is included (except Kickstart ROM ðŸ˜’). Ready to go make your next Amiga 500 production!
- State-of-the-art code generation by GCC with Link-Time-Optimizations (LTO) for increased performance and smaller code size
- IntelliSense
- Full source-level and assembly-level debugging with callstack, breakpoints, watches, registers, memory view with GDB-enabled WinUAE
- Fully AmigaOS compatible via included .h files
- `INCBIN` support
- Output to debug console from WinUAE
- WinUAE warp-launch (turbo-boot)
- WinUAE warp-mode control from your Amiga project

## How-to-use
- `amiga: View Memory`, `amiga: Set Force Disassembly`, `amiga: View Disassembly (Function)` are available from the command palette <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd>
- WinUAE: 
  - <kbd>^</kbd> = single step, <kbd>Pause</kbd> = pause/resume <kbd>Page-up</kbd> = warp mode
  - all necessary options are already configured for Amiga 500, Kickstart 1.3 (for debugging), if you want to change some things (resolution, window size, etc.) just go into the `Configurations` tab, select `default`, and hit `Save`

## Acknowledgements
This extension is based in part on Marcel Ball's [Cortex-Debug](https://github.com/Marus/cortex-debug) extension.

Some modifications of GCC are based on work by [Stefan "Bebbo" Franke](https://github.com/bebbo).

Amiga system-includes (NDK 3.9) copied from an installation of Bebbo's [amiga-gcc](https://github.com/bebbo/amiga-gcc/blob/master/Makefile) and modified to work with GCC 8. Originally downloaded from http://www.haage-partner.de/download/AmigaOS/NDK39.lha

## Known Issues

* package.json fertigmachen. Configs, settings, ...
* store assembly breakpoints in one "virtual" file in breakpointMap (how?!)
* when stepping out of IRQ handler, stack frames are corrupt until next step
* disassemble address always creates new disassembly even if just stepping. check title of current disassembly window if current PC is in range.
* sometimes fail at start: Unable to open 'main.amigaasm': Cannot read property 'customRequest' of undefined.
* restartRequest not implemented
* vscode.debug.activeDebugSession is undefined when program is stopped on entry
* not getting handleThreadSelected(), thread ID now set in class
* sometimes Pause/Resume button doesn't correctly switch to "Pause" icon while amiga program is running
* step out of kickstart: set fake breakpoint at 0xfffffff, WinUAE should enter TRACE_RANGE_PC mode (TODO: tighten range around loaded program), but keeps breaking later
